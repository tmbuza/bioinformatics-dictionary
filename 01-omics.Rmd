## Term: Nucleotide

### Definition
A nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. It consists of three main components:
- A nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine in DNA; adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil in RNA)
- A pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA; ribose in RNA)
- A phosphate group

Nucleotides are linked together through phosphodiester bonds to form polynucleotide chains, which serve as the backbone of nucleic acid molecules.

### R code illustration

```R
library(Biostrings)
# Define a DNA sequence
dna_sequence <- DNAString("ATCGATCGATCG")

# Calculate the length of the DNA sequence
sequence_length <- length(dna_sequence)

# Print the length of the DNA sequence
print(paste("Length of DNA sequence:", sequence_length))


```

### Interpretation
A **nucleotide** is a fundamental unit of nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA. It is composed of three main components:

- **Nitrogenous Base**: The character representing the nitrogenous base determines the identity of the nucleotide. In DNA, the nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine. These bases carry genetic information and form complementary base pairs, crucial for DNA replication and protein synthesis.

- **Pentose Sugar**: The pentose sugar is represented by the character 'D' in DNA (deoxyribose) and 'R' in RNA (ribose). The type of sugar influences the stability and functionality of the nucleotide.

- **Phosphate Group**: The phosphate group is represented by the character 'P'. It provides the backbone structure of the nucleic acid chain and is responsible for linking adjacent nucleotides through phosphodiester bonds.

Understanding the character representation of nucleotides allows researchers to interpret genetic sequences, analyze DNA and RNA structures, and investigate biological processes such as replication, transcription, and translation.

## Term: Open Reading Frame {#orf}
### Definition
An Open Reading Frame (ORF) is a stretch of DNA or RNA sequence that does not contain stop codons and has the potential to be translated into a protein. It begins with a start codon (usually AUG) and ends with a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA). ORFs are essential components of gene annotation and genome analysis, as they provide insights into potential protein-coding regions within a nucleotide sequence.

### R code illustration
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the crayon package
# Load the crayon package
library(crayon)

# Function to highlight start and stop codons in a DNA sequence
highlight_codon <- function(sequence) {
  colored_sequence <- gsub("ATG", crayon::red("ATG"), sequence)  # Highlight start codon in red
  colored_sequence <- gsub("TAA", crayon::yellow("TAA"), colored_sequence)  # Highlight TAA stop codon in yellow
  colored_sequence <- gsub("TAG", crayon::yellow("TAG"), colored_sequence)  # Highlight TAG stop codon in yellow
  colored_sequence <- gsub("TGA", crayon::yellow("TGA"), colored_sequence)  # Highlight TGA stop codon in yellow
  return(colored_sequence)
}

# Generate a synthetic DNA sequence with multiple start and stop codons
set.seed(42)
prefix <- paste(sample(c("A", "T", "G", "C"), 20, replace = TRUE), collapse = "")
start_codon <- "ATG"
body <- paste(sample(c("A", "T", "G", "C"), 20, replace = TRUE), collapse = "")

# Stop codons
stop_codon1 <- "TAA"
stop_codon2 <- "TAG"
stop_codon3 <- "TGA"

# Combine sequence parts with stop codons
sequence <- paste(prefix, start_codon, body, stop_codon1, body, start_codon, body, stop_codon2, body, start_codon, body, stop_codon3, body, sep = "")

# Highlight start and stop codons
colored_sequence <- highlight_codon(sequence)

# Print the colored sequence
cat(colored_sequence)

```



```

### Interpretation
- We load two R packages:
  - Biostrings: A package for handling biological sequences like DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.
  - ORFik: A package specifically designed for detecting open reading frames (ORFs) in DNA sequences.
- Sample DNA Sequences: We define a vector dna_sequences containing two DNA sequences as character strings. These sequences represent segments of DNA.
- Converting DNA Sequences: We convert the character vector dna_sequences into a DNAStringSet object, which is a data structure provided by the Biostrings package to efficiently handle multiple DNA sequences.
- Finding Open Reading Frames (ORFs): We use the findORFs function from the ORFik package to identify open reading frames within the DNA sequences. An open reading frame (ORF) is a portion of DNA sequence that has the potential to encode a protein. ORFs typically start with a start codon (e.g., ATG) and end with a stop codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, or TGA).
- Printing Identified ORFs: We print the identified ORFs, which are represented as a data frame containing information about the start and end positions of each ORF, the length of the ORF, and the frame in which it was found.

> In summary, the R code demonstrates how to use the ORFik package to detect potential protein-coding regions (ORFs) within DNA sequences, which is a crucial step in analyzing genetic data and understanding gene function.


## Term: Glycomics
### Definition
Glycomics is the study of the structure, function, and biology of carbohydrates (also known as glycans) in biological systems. It involves the comprehensive analysis of the glycome, which refers to the entire complement of glycans within an organism, cell, or tissue. Glycans are essential biomolecules involved in various biological processes, including cell-cell recognition, signaling, immune response, and protein folding.

## Term: Non Protein-Coding
### Definition
Non-protein coding refers to regions of the genome that do not code for proteins. Instead, these regions may have other functional roles, such as regulating gene expression, serving as binding sites for regulatory proteins, or being transcribed into non-coding RNAs. Non-protein coding regions include introns, intergenic regions, and various types of non-coding RNAs, such as transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).

### R code illustration
```R

# Dummy function to identify non-protein coding regions
identify_non_protein_coding_regions <- function(dna_sequences) {
  # Perform some analysis or pattern matching to identify non-protein coding regions
  # For example, identifying introns, intergenic regions, or non-coding RNAs
  # This could involve using machine learning techniques or biological knowledge
  
  # For demonstration purposes, we simply return a dummy result
  non_protein_coding_regions <- list(start = c(100, 300), end = c(200, 400))
  return(non_protein_coding_regions)
}

# Identify non-protein coding regions
non_protein_coding_regions <- identify_non_protein_coding_regions(dna_sequences)

# Print identified non-protein coding regions
print(non_protein_coding_regions)


```


```

### Interpretation
This R code is a conceptual example for identifying non-protein coding regions in DNA sequences. Since R itself doesn't provide direct functions to identify non-protein coding regions, this example illustrates a simplified approach.

- Sample DNA Sequences: We define a vector dna_sequences containing two DNA sequences as character strings. These sequences represent segments of DNA.
- Identifying Non-Protein Coding Regions: We use a dummy function identify_non_protein_coding_regions to identify non-protein coding regions within the DNA sequences.

## Term: Exon and Intron
### Definition
Exons and introns are two types of sequences found within genes, especially in eukaryotic organisms. Here's the definition of each:

#### Exon
- Exons are the coding regions of a gene that are transcribed into mRNA and eventually translated into proteins during gene expression.
- These regions contain the actual genetic information that specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein.
- Exons are interspersed among introns within a gene.
- They are typically relatively short compared to introns.

#### Intron
- Introns are non-coding regions of a gene that are interspersed among exons.
- They are transcribed into pre-mRNA along with exons but are removed through a process called splicing to produce mature mRNA.
- Introns do not code for proteins and were once considered "junk" DNA, but recent research suggests they may have regulatory functions.
- Introns are typically longer than exons and can vary significantly in length between genes.
- In summary, exons contain the coding information for proteins, while introns are non-coding regions that are removed during mRNA processing. Both exons and introns are essential components of gene structure and play crucial roles in gene expression and regulation in eukaryotic organisms.

### R code illustration

```{r}
# Example R code for illustrating exons in a gene

# Define a gene with exons and introns

  exon1 = c(100, 200),   # Exon 1: Start position 100, end position 200
  intron1 = c(201, 300), # Intron 1: Start position 201, end position 300
  exon2 = c(301, 400)    # Exon 2: Start position 301, end position 400
)

# Plot the gene structure
plot(1, type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", xlim = c(0, 500), ylim = c(0, 2), main = "Gene Structure")
rect(gene_structure$exon1[1], 1, gene_structure$exon1[2], 1.5, col = "lightblue", border = NA)
rect(gene_structure$intron1[1], 0.75, gene_structure$intron1[2], 1.75, col = "lightgrey", border = NA)
rect(gene_structure$exon2[1], 1, gene_structure$exon2[2], 1.5, col = "lightblue", border = NA)
text(gene_structure$exon1[1] + 50, 1.25, "Exon 1", cex = 0.8)
text(mean(gene_structure$intron1), 1, "Intron 1", cex = 0.8)
text(gene_structure$exon2[1] + 50, 1.25, "Exon 2", cex = 0.8)


```


```

### Interpretation
This R code illustrates the concept of exons in a gene by plotting the gene structure.

- Gene Structure: We define a gene structure consisting of exons and introns. Exons are represented by light blue rectangles, while introns are represented by light gray rectangles.
  - Exon 1 spans from position 100 to 200.
  - Intron 1 spans from position 201 to 300.
  - Exon 2 spans from position 301 to 400.

## Term: Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)
### Definition
A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is a research method in genetics aimed at identifying genetic variants across the entire genome that are associated with specific traits or diseases. This approach involves analyzing genetic data from large populations to pinpoint variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that correlate with the trait or disease being studied. GWAS have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases, enabling the discovery of potential therapeutic targets and personalized medicine strategies.

### R code and interpretation
```{r gwas}
# Example GWAS or GWAA analysis using qqman package
library(qqman)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load example GWAS or GWAA results data
data("gwasResults")
head(gwasResults)

# Plot Manhattan plot for GWAS or GWAA
manhattan_plot <- gwasResults %>%
  manhattan(chr = "CHR", bp = "BP", snp = "SNP", p = "P",
            col = c("green3", "orange"),
            suggestiveline = -log10(1e-04), logp = TRUE)


```

### Interpretation
- This sample dataset, named gwasResults, contains information about genetic variants (SNPs), their chromosomal positions (CHR and BP), SNP identifiers (SNP), and association p-values (P).
- The manhattan() function from the qqman package is used to generate a Manhattan plot based on the loaded GWAS or GWAA results data. 
- The Manhattan plot visualizes the strength and genomic locations of associations between genetic variants and a trait of interest. 
- The negative logarithm of the p-values is plotted on the y-axis against genomic positions on the x-axis. 
- Chromosomes are typically represented by different colors or panels, and horizontal lines indicate thresholds for suggestive or genome-wide significance levels.

> By analyzing the Manhattan plot, researchers can identify regions of the genome that are significantly associated with the trait under investigation, potentially leading to the discovery of candidate genes or biological pathways involved in the phenotype.



## Term: Genome-wide association analysis (GWAA)
### Definition
Genome-wide association analysis (GWAA) is a statistical method used to identify associations between genetic variants across the entire genome and a specific trait or phenotype. Unlike GWAS, which focuses on identifying associations at the level of individual genetic variants (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), GWAA considers broader patterns of genetic variation, such as haplotypes or genetic regions, in relation to the trait under investigation.

### R Code Illustration
```{r gwaa}
# Example GWAA analysis with QQ plot using qqman package
library(qqman)
library(dplyr)

# Load example GWAA results data
data("gwasResults")
head(gwasResults)

# Create QQ plot
qq_plot <- qq(gwasResults$P, main = "QQ Plot for GWAA Results")



```

### Interpretation
- In addition to Manhattan plots, another commonly used plot for genome-wide association analysis (GWAA) or GWAS is the Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot. 
- QQ plots are useful for assessing the overall distribution of test statistics (e.g., p-values) from GWAA or GWAS results and for detecting potential inflation or deflation of test statistics, which may indicate population stratification or other sources of bias.
- We load example GWAA results data using the data("gwasResults") function.
- We then use the qq() function from the qqman package to create a QQ plot. This function takes the p-values (P) from the GWAA results data as input and generates the QQ plot.

> The resulting QQ plot allows you to visually inspect whether the distribution of p-values from the GWAA analysis deviates from the expected null distribution under the assumption of no association. Deviations from the diagonal line may indicate potential issues such as population stratification or other sources of bias in the analysis


## Term: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE)
### Definition
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) is a machine learning algorithm used for visualizing high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional space, typically two dimensions. It is commonly applied in bioinformatics to visualize and explore high-dimensional datasets such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data or multi-omics data. tSNE works by modeling the similarity between data points in high-dimensional space and then embedding them into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the local structure of the data.

### R Code Illustration

```{r}
# Example tSNE analysis with grouping and colored clusters using the Rtsne package
library(Rtsne)
library(ggplot2)

# Simulate synthetic high-dimensional data with six clusters
set.seed(42)
n <- 1000  # Number of samples
p <- 100   # Number of features

# Generate data for six clusters with minimal overlap
cluster1 <- matrix(rnorm(n * p, mean = 11, sd = 1.5), nrow = n, ncol = p)
cluster2 <- matrix(rnorm(n * p, mean = 10, sd = 2), nrow = n, ncol = p)
cluster3 <- matrix(rnorm(n * p, mean = 15, sd = 4), nrow = n, ncol = p)
cluster4 <- matrix(rnorm(n * p, mean = 12, sd = 4.4), nrow = n, ncol = p)
cluster5 <- matrix(rnorm(n * p, mean = 9, sd = 2.5), nrow = n, ncol = p)
cluster6 <- matrix(rnorm(n * p, mean = 13, sd = 3.5), nrow = n, ncol = p)

# Combine the clusters
data <- rbind(cluster1, cluster2, cluster3, cluster4, cluster5, cluster6)

# Perform tSNE
tsne_result <- Rtsne(data, dims = 2)

# Generate group labels
group_labels <- rep(1:6, each = n)

# Create data frame for plotting
tsne_df <- data.frame(X = tsne_result$Y[,1], Y = tsne_result$Y[,2], Group = factor(group_labels))

# Plot tSNE result with colored clusters
ggplot(tsne_df, aes(x = X, y = Y, color = Group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "tSNE Plot with 6 Clusters (Some Overlapping)", x = "tSNE1", y = "tSNE2") +
  theme_light()


```



```

### Interpretation

1. **Cluster Separation**: The plot displays distinct clusters of points, each marked with a different color representing a separate group or cluster. Despite some overlapping between clusters, relatively distinct groupings are discernible.

2. **Cluster Density**: Density of points within each cluster indicates the concentration of data points belonging to that group. Denser regions within a cluster suggest a higher density of data points sharing similar characteristics.

3. **Overlap**: While there is some overlapping between clusters, it's not extensive, suggesting that while there are shared characteristics between groups, there are also distinguishing features that separate them.

4. **Outliers**: Outliers, if present, can be identified as data points that are isolated or located far away from any cluster. They represent data points that deviate significantly from the typical patterns observed within the dataset.

5. **Group Relationships**: Spatial relationships between clusters provide insights into potential relationships or similarities between different groups. Closer proximity between clusters may suggest similar characteristics or relationships between those groups.

Overall, the tSNE plot provides a visual representation of the underlying structure of the high-dimensional data, making it easier to explore and interpret complex datasets. However, interpretations should be made cautiously, considering the limitations and assumptions of the tSNE algorithm.


## Term: Single-Cell Data Analysis

# Simulate synthetic epigenomic data
set.seed(123)
num_samples <- 100
num_features <- 5000
epigenomic_data <- matrix(rnorm(num_samples * num_features), nrow = num_samples)

# Perform principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
pca_result <- prcomp(epigenomic_data)

# Visualize the first two principal components
plot(pca_result$x[, 1], pca_result$x[, 2], 
     xlab = "Principal Component 1", ylab = "Principal Component 2", 
     main = "PCA of Epigenomic Data")

```


```

### Interpretation
- Synthetic epigenomic data is generated using the rnorm function to create random normal distributed values.

## Term: Variant Calling
### Definition
Variant calling refers to the process of identifying genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and structural variations, from DNA sequencing data. It involves comparing sequence data to a reference genome or a control sample to detect differences that may represent genetic variations.

### R Code Illustration:

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(VariantAnnotation)

# Simulate synthetic variants
set.seed(123)
chromosomes <- c(rep("chr1", 100), rep("chr2", 200))  # Example chromosomes
positions <- sample(1:1e6, 300, replace = TRUE)  # Example positions
ref_alleles <- sample(c("A", "C", "G", "T"), 300, replace = TRUE)  # Example reference alleles
alt_alleles <- sample(c("A", "C", "G", "T"), 300, replace = TRUE)  # Example alternate alleles

# Create a VCF object
vcf <- DataFrame(CHROM = chromosomes, POS = positions, ID = ".", 
                 REF = ref_alleles, ALT = alt_alleles, QUAL = ".", FILTER = ".", INFO = ".")

# Print the VCF object
print(head(vcf[, 1:6]))

# Plot the distribution of variants across chromosomes
ggplot(vcf, aes(x = CHROM)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Chromosome", y = "Number of Variants", title = "Distribution of Variants Across Chromosomes")

# Plot the distribution of variant allele frequencies
variant_freq <- sample(seq(0.01, 0.99, by = 0.01), 300, replace = TRUE)  # Example variant frequencies
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = variant_freq), bins = 20, fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Variant Allele Frequency", y = "Frequency Count", title = "Distribution of Variant Allele Frequencies")

# Plot the type of variants (SNPs, indels, etc.)
variant_types <- sample(c("SNP", "Indel", "Structural", "CNV"), 300, replace = TRUE)  # Example variant types
ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = variant_types), fill = "green", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Variant Type", y = "Count", title = "Distribution of Variant Types")


```

### Interpretation
The code simulates synthetic variant calling data, representing genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or small insertions/deletions (indels). Here's what each component of the generated data represents:

- **CHROM**: Chromosome where the variant is located. In this example, variants are randomly assigned to either "chr1" or "chr2".
- **POS**: Position on the chromosome where the variant is located, specified in genomic coordinates.
- **ID**: Unique identifier for the variant. In this synthetic data, each variant is assigned "." as its identifier.
- **REF**: Reference allele at the variant position. This represents the nucleotide present in the reference genome at the variant position.
- **ALT**: Alternate allele(s) observed in the sample. These alleles differ from the reference allele and represent the genetic variation observed at the variant position.
- **QUAL**: Quality score assigned to the variant, indicating the confidence in the variant call. In this example, each variant is assigned "." as its quality score.
- **FILTER**: Filter status indicating whether the variant passes certain quality filters. In this synthetic data, each variant is assigned "." indicating it has not been filtered.
- **INFO**: Additional information about the variant. In this example, each variant is assigned "." as its additional information.

This synthetic variant calling data provides a simplified representation of genetic variation at specific genomic positions and can be used for testing and demonstration purposes in variant calling pipelines and analyses.

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(DESeq2)
library(airway)

# Load example RNA-Seq count data
data("airway")
airway <- airway

# Perform differential gene expression analysis
dds <- DESeqDataSet(airway, design = ~cell + dex)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds)

# Plot differential expression results with legend
plotMA(res, main = "MA Plot of Differential Expression")



```

### Interpretation
The code performs differential gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq count data from the 'airway' dataset:

1. **Load necessary library**: The code loads the 'DESeq2' library, which is used for differential gene expression analysis.

2. **Load example RNA-Seq count data**: The 'airway' dataset is loaded into the R environment. This dataset contains RNA-Seq count data from airway epithelial cells treated with dexamethasone (dex) or control (non-dex).

3. **Perform differential gene expression analysis**: The 'DESeqDataSet' function is used to create a DESeqDataSet object from the 'airway' dataset, specifying the experimental design formula (~cell + dex). Differential gene expression analysis is performed using the 'DESeq' function.

4. **Extract differential expression results**: The 'results' function is applied to the DESeqDataSet object ('dds') to extract differential expression results ('res').

5. **Plot differential expression results**: The 'plotMA' function is used to generate an MA plot of the differential expression results. The MA plot visualizes the log-fold change (M) versus the mean average expression (A) of genes, providing insights into differential expression patterns between conditions.

set.seed(123)

# Define the number of synthetic TSS regions
num_regions <- 10

# Generate synthetic TSS regions
synthetic_tss <- data.frame(
  chromosome = sample(c("chr1", "chr2", "chr3"), num_regions, replace = TRUE),
  start = sample(1:1000000, num_regions, replace = TRUE),
  end = NA  # End coordinates can be calculated based on start coordinates
)

# Calculate end coordinates
synthetic_tss$end <- synthetic_tss$start + 100

# View the synthetic TSS regions
head(synthetic_tss)

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Create a ggplot object to plot synthetic TSS regions
tss_plot <- ggplot(synthetic_tss, aes(x = start, y = chromosome)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Synthetic TSS Regions", x = "Start Coordinate", y = "Chromosome") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the plot
print(tss_plot)


```

### Interpretation

The scatter plot visualizes synthetic transcription start site (TSS) regions across different chromosomes. Each point on the plot represents the start coordinate of a synthetic TSS region, with chromosomes distinguished along the y-axis. Here's what we can infer from the plot:

- **Distribution of TSS Regions**: The plot provides an overview of the distribution of synthetic TSS regions along the genome. We can observe the arrangement of TSS regions on different chromosomes, allowing us to identify any clustering or dispersion patterns.

- **Chromosomal Localization**: By examining the y-axis, we can determine the chromosomes where the TSS regions are located. This information is crucial for understanding the genomic context of gene expression regulation and functional genomic elements.

- **Randomness in Coordinates**: Since the synthetic TSS regions were generated randomly, the plot showcases the random distribution of TSS regions across the genome. This randomness is evident in the distribution of points along the x-axis.

- **Potential Insights**: While the plot represents synthetic data, similar visualizations with real TSS regions can provide insights into the genomic organization of transcription initiation sites and their regulatory mechanisms.

Overall, the plot offers a visual representation of synthetic TSS regions, aiding in the exploration and analysis of genomic data related to gene expression and transcriptional regulation.



## Term: Comparative Genomics
### Definition
Comparative genomics is the study of evolutionary relationships and genomic variations among different species or related organisms. It involves comparing genome sequences to identify conserved regions, gene orthologs, evolutionary changes, and genomic rearrangements, providing insights into genetic diversity and evolutionary processes.

### R Code Illustration
```{r comparativegenomics}
# Load necessary library
library(Biostrings)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate synthetic genome sequences
num_seqs <- 10
mean_length <- 1000
gc_content <- 0.5
synthetic_sequences <- DNAStringSet(
  sapply(1:num_seqs, function(i) {
    sample(c("A", "C", "G", "T"), mean_length, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.25 - gc_content/2, gc_content/2, gc_content/2, 0.25 - gc_content/2))
  })
)

# Calculate genetic distances
distances <- matrix(NA, nrow = num_seqs, ncol = num_seqs)
for (i in 1:num_seqs) {
  for (j in 1:num_seqs) {
    distances[i, j] <- sum(as.character(synthetic_sequences[i]) != as.character(synthetic_sequences[j]))
  }
}

# Visualize genetic distances using a heatmap
heatmap(distances, 
        Rowv = NA, Colv = NA, 
        col = colorRampPalette(c("green3", "white", "red"))(100),
        main = "Genetic Distance Heatmap")


```

### Interpretation
The heatmap displays genetic distances between synthetic DNA sequences generated for the analysis. Here's what we can infer from the heatmap:

- **Genetic Distance Representation**: Each cell in the heatmap represents the genetic distance between two DNA sequences. Darker colors indicate higher distances, suggesting greater dissimilarity between sequences, while lighter colors indicate lower distances, indicating greater similarity.

- Lowly expressed genes are filtered out from the dataset using the `cpm()` function, which calculates counts per million (CPM), and the `rowSums()` function. This step helps remove genes with low read counts that may not be reliable for analysis.
- Differential expression analysis is performed using a generalized linear model (GLM) approach. First, a design matrix is created using the `model.matrix()` function to specify the experimental design, which includes the conditions or treatments being compared.
- The dispersion of the data is estimated using the `estimateDisp()` function, and the GLM is fitted to the data using the `glmFit()` function.
- A likelihood ratio test (LRT) is performed on the fitted model using the `glmLRT()` function to identify genes that are differentially expressed between conditions or treatments.
- The results of the LRT are summarized, and the table of differentially expressed genes is extracted using the `topTags()` function.
- Finally, significant genes are selected based on a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05, and the top significant genes are displayed.
