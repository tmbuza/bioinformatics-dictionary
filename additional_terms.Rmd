# Additional Terms

## Term: Homology Modeling  
### Definition

## Term: Phylogenetics  
### Definition
The study of evolutionary relationships among organisms based on genetic data, such as DNA or protein sequences, to reconstruct evolutionary trees or phylogenetic networks.

## Term: Phylogenetics  
### Definition
The study of evolutionary relationships among organisms based on genetic data, such as DNA or protein sequences, to reconstruct evolutionary trees or phylogenetic networks.
### R code illustration

```{r phylogenetics}
# Example R code for phylogenetic analysis
# You can use packages like ape for phylogenetic tree construction
library(ape)

# Simulate a random phylogenetic tree
tree <- rtree(10)

# Plot the phylogenetic tree
plot(tree)


```


```

### Interpretation
- This R code generates a random phylogenetic tree with 10 tips using the rtree function from the ape package. 
- The resulting tree object can be visualized using the plot function, providing insight into the evolutionary relationships among the simulated organisms.
